# Day 2 - Get Familiar with Android Studio

## ✅ Objectives
- [x] Learned more about git
- [x] More payment methods are added
- [x] Cart dialog is added
- [x] Receipt is added
- [x] The project is pushed to git

## 📘 What I Learned
- I had learned more about git while I was trying to solve push problems
- I learned what is build variant
It is an important approach when a programmer serves multiple companies. With build variant there are multiple themes that can be added to the project without changing the code. If a certain company hass the theme red and another company wants a blue theme it can be done by build variant.
- I learned more about design patterns. Especially, MVC.

## ❓ Questions
What is git.ignore and how to edit wiki on git?
Are there any design patterns that are more compatible than MVC and can I implement them on my project?

## 💬 Reflection
I had problems with build in graddle and git in general. It consumed most of my time but in the end I was able to solve both of these problems and I know in the following days the kotlin part of my project will be smoother since I'am now more familiar with the base of it.
