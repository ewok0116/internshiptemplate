# Day 10 – Finished DB-AndroidStudio Connection

## ✅ Objectives
- [x] Created Order Feature
- [x] Created OrderItem Feature
- [x] Establish a working connection

## 📘 What I Learned
- Today was more about implementing what I know, and while implementing I realized that I do not need another endpoint for OrderItems since it has some kind of a connection with the Order. But still need to check more on that. Untill this realization, the process of trying to make OrderItem enpoint consumed a lot of time. Because a feature for OrderItem was added. In addition, there was a confusion whether the OrderItem should get 1 order or more. In other words, I had problem deciding what to do because sometimes more than one order is given. Therefore, while making the handler I tried both ways and in the end decided to go with 2 handlers; one getting 1 order and other more order.

## ❓ Questions
- Do I need GetOrder or Does GetOrderItem is enough on my web service?

## 💬 Reflection
- I was a bit relaxed after I established a connection and felt like the whole project has ended, therefore I did made a mistake on not writing the daily and weekly on time. This will not happen again.
