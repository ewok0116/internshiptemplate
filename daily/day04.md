# Day 4 - Starting DB and Web service

## ‚úÖ Objectives
- [x] Download SSMS
- [x] Create DB
- [ ] Connect DB from Mac
- [x] Create .gitignore
- [x] Study .NET 



## üìò What I Learned
- Learned that .gitignore tells us which files and directories should be ignored and for my project I created gitignore and deleted the files that are not necessary or should be private. The .gitignore should be find in Week-1 log.
- Learned that SSMS can only be downloaded to Mac by using other tools like Docker therefore I needed a Windows computer. I downloaded SSMS there and Created a DB. The creation Query can be found in GitHub projects/Backend/SQLquery1.sql.
- Learned some basics of .NET from Youtube which videos I watched can be found under Week-1 log.


## ‚ùì Questions
-I couldn't quite get what is ASP.NET and just .NET. One of them is yes the founder the base and ASP is part of .NET, but I was wondering when I write a code on .NET 8 is it automcatically become ASP or do I use ASP when I try to use web API

## üí¨ Reflection
Tried to connect my Mac to a Windows computer however was not successful since bunch of errors occured because of SQL authentication. Therefore, I chose Windows Auth. however this time I had problems connecting Mac to my windows device because I learned that it is not possible to connect if Windows Auth. is chosen, and that trying to gather connection part consumed huge amount of time today and in the end I could not solve it which motivated me and made me furious at the same time therefore I will be solving that connection problem this weekend.
