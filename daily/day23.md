# Day 23 – Presentation Day

## ✅ Objectives
- [x] Did a Presentation
- [x] Changed password dialog workflow
- [x] Created wiki

## 📘 What I Learned
- Today, I realised that the dialog for the ConfigPassword should have taken the password I created, and it should appear after the first connection. Therefore, I changed the flow of the program on MainActivity.
- I did my Demo and Presentation todat. It was great. I'am quite happy with the result. If I could have done unit testing though I would have been thrilled.
- I also created a wiki.

## ❓ Questions
- Did Kenan Abi wanted to give his keyboard to me?

## 💬 Reflection
- I'am happy with the ending. I loved it here and wish I had more time so that I could have done Unit testing and maybe DevOps.
