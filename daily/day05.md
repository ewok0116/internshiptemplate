# Day 5 ‚Äì Retrieve Data From DB

## ‚úÖ Objectives
- [x] Create a web service
- [x] Get the data from DB
- [x] GET data from DB
- [ ] POST data to DB
- [x] Initial Project was made on git and added some issues


## üìò What I Learned
- In the process of creating the web service I got familiar with the SQL server management system and I solved the connection problem by making the authentication mixed. In other words, I chose SQL server and Windows Authenticaiton at the same time. 
- I learned that to connect the DB I need to be on the same network. Out of curiousity I tested it with different networks but in the end I needed VPN to establish connection. 
- Last time I had a question about the usage of ASP network and today I learned that I use it on my project cause it helps me with the web framework. The project could have been implemented without it but it made the process faster and more efficient. Because of Controller pattern, Built-in SQL server support etc.
- I learned how to create a project and submit issues to git.



## ‚ùì Questions
- What exactly is Ansi-SQL?
- How to POST data to DB


## üí¨ Reflection
I lost some time while figuring why the connection was not established. In the end, I remembered that the IP might change and it became a practice for me to check IP before starting the web service. Moreover, For controllers I need to seperate each of them to make the code look more neat. In addition, I was able to GET but not POST, and while I was trying to figure POST my code became unreadable at some point therefore I need to organize my code. Like I said I had learned how to create a project and submit issues to git. However did not have enough time to detailly explain it in the wanted format. Tomorrow I will be looking onto that.
