# Day 17 ‚Äì Finished Core Frontend
## ‚úÖ Objectives
- [x] Created a working Frontend with clean architecture
- [x] Solved Connection problems
- [x] Learned logcat
      
## üìò What I Learned
- Today I learned that the connection problem I had was due to trying to establishing connection, after initializing viewmodel. After I solve that problem another connection problem occured in Payment side, and that was due to hidePayment() function turning SUCCESS to NONE. (More details can be found in logs Week4 day 17)
- In addition, while I was trying to solve the connection problem. I was having trouble on where to start looking for the debug. In the end, I got some help and learned that there is a tool called logcat. In which I was able to see where did the error occured. In the end, the problem was solved thanks to that.
- Moreover, I tested my Backend. Yesterday, I did finished webAPI of backend but could not have an opportunity to test it. Today along with Frontend I was able to test Backend webAPI.

## ‚ùì Questions
- Where should I add encryption in my code?

## üí¨ Reflection
- Today, I spent the whole day debugging and checking logcat. It felt like infinity. Last 5 minutes before leaving I was able to solve the Payment connection problem though. Which relieved me in a way that I cannot express it words.
