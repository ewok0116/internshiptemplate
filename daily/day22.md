# Day 22 – Presentation Preparation

## ✅ Objectives
- [x] Finished presentation.
- [x] Changed the data gathering format.
- [x] Checked ANSI 

## 📘 What I Learned
- I learned that ANSI cannot be 100% compatible with DBMSs.
- Preparing a presentation takes more time than I expected.
- I used to get data from DB 2 times. One with GetDatabyCategory and other with loadAlldata. Now I got rid of GetDatabyCategory, and only getting data with loadAlldata.

## ❓ Questions
- My WebAPI part is seperated from the feature. But do I still show it in the schema as the shared layers?

## 💬 Reflection
- I'am stressed about the presentation. I had a misscommunication with Esra about the password dialog. I need to fix that.
