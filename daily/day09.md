# Day 9 ‚Äì Intial Backend Making-Connection Problem

## ‚úÖ Objectives
- [x] Finished the Architecture design
- [x] Added Category, Products entities
- [x] Created new Collection on Postman
- [x] Checked Swagger

## üìò What I Learned
-I learned that there is anothert tool for testing RESTful APIs called Swagger and unlike Postman otehr people can see my collections with the URL. Other than that today was more about
applied what I know, therefore today I did not learn much.

## ‚ùì Questions
- Why does the work computer can not connect to my MAC but other windows devices can? What is the problem? I did the same thing.

## üí¨ Reflection
Today I felt great. Since my architecture is now set. It was easier to implement on that and I got faster. I kind of finished all features but not sure about POST part, because it
created problems on Android Studio part and then my Android Studio crashed. Therefore that aprt is not commited yet. In addition, I FINALLY HAD NO PROBLEM WITH GIT. Today was great.
