# Day 3 - Finishing the Initial Design

## ✅ Objectives
- [x] Learned more about git
- [x] Payment method is non-cancellable
- [x] Added Homepage
- [x] Added Config Page
- [x] Learned more abput MVC and MVVM

## 📘 What I Learned
- I had learned more about git while I was trying to solve push problems. It consumed a lot of time.
- I learned more about design patterns. Especially MVC and MVVM. MVC is a traditional pattern for androids. It means Model-View-Controller whereas MVVM means Model-View-Viewmodel.
As it can be seen MVVM is a variation of MVC. I learned that it is mostly used in frameworks. In addition, I will start my android studio project with MVC.

## ❓ Questions
What is git.ignore and how to edit wiki on git?
How to combine MVC and MVVM? also still dont quite get how Intent works.

## 💬 Reflection
I learned more about designing patterns but mostly what are they and in what circumstances they are used for, however still not feeling confident enough to understand which coding pattern relates to which design pattern
