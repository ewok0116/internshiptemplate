- [x] Dependency Injection and Inversion for OrderItem part.

## 📘 What I Learned
- Today I learned PUT HTTP method and its difference from GET adn POST I used it in the Backend UodateStatus Feature. POST changes the data, but cretaes duplicatess; GET does not changes the dat aand does not creat duplicatess.
Whereas PUT changes data and does not creat duplicates.PUT is used mostly on Update operations becausse of that. Like it is used in my project. PUT is used for updateing the status. What I did today can be seen in logs Week3 in a more detailed way.
