# Day 20 ‚Äì Encryption 

## ‚úÖ Objectives
- [x] Tried to Encrypt the current Frontend
- [x] Did Documentation

## üìò What I Learned
- Today, I realized that the encryption I made was not working properly. It was somehow using 2 encryption methodss of AES256, and it was creating 2 different files. It supposedly created 2 files for:
  - 1: One encrypted file 
  - 2: One non-encrypted file
which was not even wanted, in addition the encrypted one was also not encrypted.
Therefore, deleted the xml files on data-data-com.example...-shared then tried other methods for encryption this time with one file, but this time had problem with creattion.
I started over in the end, however then the shared files went misssing and after I tried several methods, whole com.example went missing. Moreover, I do not know the reason why?
- In the end, I decided to do some documentation

## ‚ùì Questions
What is the problem with my encryption? I'am not playing withe the files why do they went missing?

## üí¨ Reflection
Today, started with a connection problem. Turns out, the place I worked had some certificates or smt. that banned me from establishing connection between my backend and frontend. After I solved it, I tried to fix the encryption issue which left me in a worse place than it already was. In the end, I did some documentation but my mind stuck on encryption. The day was not efficent.
