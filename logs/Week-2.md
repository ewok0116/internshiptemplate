#Week-2 -Day-5I solved the connection problem. For authentication I used mixed which is both windows and SQL server authentication. After that, I wrote a basic code that approves my connection to the SSMS server. Then, I created a folder called MyDataBaseAPI which is the web service for my project. In the folder I have 2 files. DataBaseController.cs in which I keep the controllers (But I need to separate each controller for my code to become more clear for others) and Program.cs in which server is set to listen to port 5093 and configures controllers. Then I established connection with the SSMS and checked it on Postman. Thanks to Postman I was able to change the controller file in a wanted format. In other words, I had problems with the column, row names but with Postman it was easier to detect parts that needed change. Then, I started implementing my code in Android Studio, I was able to do the GET part, and to handle all the network connection I created a file called ApiService.kt that creates an interface that maps HTTP endpoints to Kotlin functions, moreover, this file acts as a translator that converts my app's Kotlin objects into JSON for sending to the server, makes HTTP calls to my  API endpoints, and then converts the JSON responses back into Kotlin objects that my Android app can use. However, I got stuck on POST part, therefore this part might need implementation. Then, before making any more changes, I decided to push it all to git, but I must have made a mistake that led me to lost the progress I made. Therefore, I needed to start over from establishing connection part. In the end I was able to achieve it but my code became messy. So, tomorrow I prioritize organizing my code first.
