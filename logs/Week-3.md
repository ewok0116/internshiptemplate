#Day-10

Today, The connection is finally finished. now the mobile applicaiton can finally show what the db has, and it also sends information to the db. I can GET the products from DB and POST the Orders to DB. Web Service works but there are codes that needs to be checked cause I did not want to break the working code. Therefore, there might be some code blocks or functions that  are not used. I need to edit these. In addition, on Android side I do not have a layout like I did on Backend. I also need to implement it on Frontend. Other than that, i kind of got relaxed after I established the connection yesterday. This should not happen again.
